Launch your favorite apps through the «Home Button Swipe Up» gesture.
Note this only works properly on devices with soft keys, like the Nexus 4 or Galaxy Nexus (i.e. devices that have virtual «Back/Home/Recent Apps» buttons).
Minimum requirement is Jelly Bean (Android 4.1).

Also see the very nice "Sudo QuickLaunch" app for reference.

This app is open source, hosted on Google Code:
