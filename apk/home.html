<h2>&lt;&lt;Home Button Launcher&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;DG Settings&gt;&gt;</h2>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

<b>Can I add more than one shortcut in the 'keyring'?</b>
<br>No, unfortunately not. That 'keyring' is standard functionality provided by the Android operating system and only supports one single item.
<br>
<br>
 
<b>How do I use this app on my Samsung phone?</b>
<br>Samsung has replaced a lot of standard Android functionality with TouchWiz features - on older Samsung phones, "long click" on the home button will open this app, on others this app does NOT integrate at all into the device buttons.
<br>=&gt; we suggest you check out this app instead:

<br>
<br>

<b>How can I toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or other system settings with your app?</b>
<br>Have a look at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dynamicg.settings">DG Settings</a>. Also watch the linked YouTube video, this shows how to integrate DG Settings.
<br>
<br>

<b>Do you have plans for Widget integration?</b>
<br>No, no such plans at the moment.
<br>
<br>

<b>Do you have plans to support "skins" or icon packs?</b>
<br>No, no such plans at the moment.
