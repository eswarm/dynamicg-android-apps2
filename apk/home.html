<h2>&lt;&lt;Home Button Launcher&gt;&gt;</h2>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

<b>Can I add more than one shortcut to the keyring?</b>
<br>No, unfortunately not. The "swipe up keyring" is standard functionality provided by the Android operating system and only supports one single item.
<br>
<br>
 
<b>How do I use this app on my Samsung phone?</b>
<br>Samsung has replaced a lot of standard Android functionality with TouchWiz features - on older Samsung phones, "long click" on the home button will open this app, on others this app does NOT integrate at all into the device buttons.
<br>=&gt; we suggest you check out this app instead:

<br>
<br>

<b>How can I toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Brightness and Auto Rotation with Home Button Launcher?</b>
<br>Have a look at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dynamicg.settings">DG Settings</a>.
Also watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytH4LMGwmUM">YouTube</a> video, this shows how to integrate DG Settings.
<br>
<br>

<b>Do you have plans for Widget integration?</b>
<br>No, this is not planned. Home Button Launcher only supports Apps and Shortcuts as of now.
<br>
<br>

<b>Do you have plans to support skins or icon packs?</b>
<br>No, this is not planned.
<br>
<br>

<b>Can you add "Direct Dial"? The app always opens the Dialer app when I tap a phone shortcut.</b>
<br>Sorry but we don't have plans to add that.
The app would require additional system access rights in order to support that ("CALL_PHONE"). 
This however is considered "dangerous" by most users, so we'd get a lot of negative feedback and 1 star ratings when asking for this.
<br>
<br>
